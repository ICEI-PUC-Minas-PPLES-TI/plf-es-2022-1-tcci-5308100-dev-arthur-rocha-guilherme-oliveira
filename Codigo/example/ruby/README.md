# Ruby

A Ruby project with [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) and [Simplecov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) requires some configuring to work with the vscode-vscode-coverage-gutters default configuration.

## Installation

Add the following to your Simplecov configuration located in the [spec_helper.rb](spec/spec_helper.rb) file.

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-lcov'

SimpleCov::Formatter::LcovFormatter.config do |c|
  c.report_with_single_file = true # vscode-coverage-gutters prefers a single file for lcov reporting
  c.output_directory = 'coverage' # vscode-coverage-gutters default directory path is 'coverage'
  c.lcov_file_name = 'lcov.info' # vscode-coverage-gutters default report filename is 'lcov.info'
end

SimpleCov.start do
  enable_coverage :branch
  formatter SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
                                                       SimpleCov::Formatter::LcovFormatter, # Add Lcov as an output when generating code coverage report
                                                       SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter # Add other outputs for the code coverage report
                                                     ])
end
```

Ensure `spec_helper.rb` is included when running your test. This example uses `.rspec` to specify additional command line arguments.

```text
...
--require spec_helper
...
```

## Usage

Run the test suite to generate the code coverage report.

  Lcov style coverage report generated for RSpec to coverage/lcov.info
  Coverage report generated for RSpec to /home/david/vscode-coverage-gutters/example/ruby/coverage. 20 / 20 LOC (100.0%) covered.
```

Code coverage files are located in the `coverage` folder.

An example [lcov.info](lcov.info) is provided in the root directory for your reference.

I find this extension works well with [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and [guard-rspec](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec) as it updates runs the tests when a file changes, which updates the gutters.
